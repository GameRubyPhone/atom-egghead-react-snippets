# Egghead React Snippets

## About
This is a port of Joe Maddalone's comprehensive snippets collection [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets), made with the help of [_atomizr_](https://github.com/idleberg/atomizr).

If you've seen Joe's videos on [Egghead](https://egghead.io), you've probably seen him use these snippets in Sublime Text. I wanted to make these available for Atom users.

## Snippets

Go to [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets) for a table of all the snippets. Currently, due to how _atomizr_ converts Sublime Text snippets, the autocomplete pop-up does not provide a useful description to the right of the snippet; I've submitted an issue with _atomizr_'s author and hope to release a new version with descriptions.
