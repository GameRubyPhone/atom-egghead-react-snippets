# Egghead React Snippets

## About
This is a port of Joe Maddalone's comprehensive snippets collection [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets), made with the help of [_atomizr_](https://github.com/idleberg/atomizr).

If you've seen Joe's videos on [Egghead](https://egghead.io), you've probably seen him use these snippets in Sublime Text. I wanted to make these available for Atom users.

## Snippets

Go to [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets) for a table of all the snippets.

## Changelog

### `1.2.0`

* Redux snippets for `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, `connect`.
* React.PropTypes snippet for `Component.propTypes = {...}`.

## Roadmap

* Make snippets compliant with AirBnB style guide.
* Add any new APIs from React v15.
* Convert tabs to spaces to handle (maybe).
* Add snippets for redux (maybe).
* Edit descriptions to make them easier to read in Atom.
* Remove React.DOM snippets (i.e. assume JSX-only workflow).
* Remove ES5 snippets (i.e. assume using ES2015+).
